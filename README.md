# Debugging
finding and fixing errors or bugs in the source code of any software.

1. You have created a file called DemoAreaa using netbeans. You are to debug the code below by encircling the error and re-writing the error in a separate sheet of paper.

2. Create a program that checks if a user is old enough to enter a certain venue. Your program should include a single class called "OldEnough." When the program runs, it should ask the user to input their age. If the user is 18 years old or older, the program should display the message "You can enter." However, if the user is under 18 years old, the program should display the message "Sorry, you are not allowed to enter." Use conditional statements to check the user's age and display the appropriate message.
